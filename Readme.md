# Synthia
<h1>Welcome to Synthia</h1>
<h3>About</h3>
<p>Synthia was originally designed to be a very short and quick project to learn about OpenAL and 
how audio works. The more I studied it, the more fascinated I was with the concept. I just found the
fundamental concept of wave manipulation to be quite interesting. Originally, I was just going to write code
to convert image data to sound data. After that was done, this project became much more.</p>
<p>Now, the goal is to create a full Synthesizer as well as editor interface for sheet music. Ideally,
users will be able to write music and listen to it as they write it! This exists already, but not in the form of 
free and open source software. For now, its become a passion project but it has a long way to go before it's usable</p>
<h3>Current Features</h3>
<ui>
<li>Code your own instruments using the built in synthesizer</li>
<li>Write your own songs and listen to them</li>
<li>Save the songs to a file</li>
<li>Load most *.wav files and listen to them</li>
</ui>
